AWS Bedrock and Azure AI Search are both fully managed services for building generative AI applications, but they differ significantly in their core purpose and capabilities. AWS Bedrock is a comprehensive platform for accessing, building, and deploying generative AI applications using a wide variety of foundation models (FMs). Azure AI Search, by contrast, is an enterprise-grade information retrieval system that provides intelligent search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities.

| Primary purpose    | A unified API gateway and toolkit for building generative AI applications, allowing you to choose from a variety of FMs.                                       | An information retrieval system for powering semantic search and RAG for conversational AI applications.                                                    |
| Foundation models  | Offers access to a marketplace of FMs from Amazon (Titan) and third-party providers like Anthropic (Claude), Cohere, and Meta.                                 | Uses models from Microsoft's AI stack (including Azure OpenAI) for integrated tasks like vectorization and semantic ranking.                                |
| RAG implementation | Provides a managed RAG solution through Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. It supports multimodal data and offers advanced chunking options.                  | Manages the indexing, retrieval, and integration steps of the RAG pipeline. It also features agentic retrieval for multi-step query planning.               |
| Agent capabilities | The managed Amazon Bedrock Agents are designed to break down tasks, create a plan, and execute complex workflows.                                              | Specializes in agentic retrieval, where an LLM is used to orchestrate query planning for retrieving data.                                                   |
| Core strength      | Multi-model choice. It provides a single point of access to a diverse set of models, simplifying the process of choosing the best one for a specific task.     | Intelligent search. It excels at turning enterprise data into a searchable index using various search methods, including hybrid search.                     |
| Integration        | Seamless integration with other AWS services like Amazon S3 and Lambda. Developers can grant access via IAM roles.                                             | Tight integration with the Azure ecosystem, including Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry. It is the core retrieval component for creating Copilots on Azure. |
| Customization      | Allows for fine-tuning, continued pre-training, and prompt engineering. Developers use the Bedrock console or SageMaker Unified Studio.                        | Offers AI enrichment capabilities via Skillsets during the indexing process.                                                                                |
| Use cases          | Content generation, chatbots, virtual assistants, creative projects, and data summarization. Also used for personalized marketing and product recommendations. | Enterprise search, powering AI agents and chatbots with private data, legal research, and document management.                                              |

## How to choose between AWS Bedrock and Azure AI Search
To decide which service is best for your project, consider these key questions:
Do you need access to a variety of models? If your strategy requires experimenting with or switching between multiple leading foundation models from different providers, AWS Bedrock offers greater flexibility.
Are you building on an existing cloud infrastructure? If your organization is already heavily invested in the AWS ecosystem, Bedrock will provide more seamless integration. Conversely, if you rely on Azure and Microsoft 365 services, Azure AI Search is a natural fit.
Is information retrieval your top priority? For applications focused on sophisticated search, like enterprise knowledge bases or document search, Azure AI Search offers more robust, purpose-built tools.
Are you focused on building agentic workflows? Both offer agentic capabilities, but their approaches differ. AWS Bedrock's agents are a complete managed solution for multi-step task execution. Azure AI Search focuses on intelligent, agent-driven retrieval as a core component of a larger agent workflow.
Is your project a simple RAG implementation? For a straightforward RAG application that connects an LLM to a data source, both services offer managed, low-code solutions. Azure AI Search has built-in indexers and processing, while AWS Bedrock provides a managed Knowledge Base.
